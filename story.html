The Ao Dai, is a symbolic dress representative of the deep history and culture of Vietnam. It has gone through a vast transformation over the years, to get to where it is today.</p>

        <h1 class="content__heading" id="a">History Of The Ao Dai</h1>
        <p class="para">
            The ao dai is thought to date back to the mid 18th century, when the Nguyen Dynasty introduced the costume as Vietnam’s national dress. Back then the garment was much looser – resembling a smock over a pair of wide-fitting trousers. The shirt was buttoned from collar to base, and was typically just below knee-length. It was also a unisex item. Today, the garment is usually seen only on women, but the style can still be seen on men for special occasions.

            <br><br>Prior to the Nguyen King’s reign, tunics tended to have scooped collars and were sleeveless. Like many Vietnamese traditions, the ao dai has its origins in the Cham community, who wore longer sleeves. It’s thought that the Nguyen king introduced the style as a concession to the Cham rulers in order to win their favor.
            
            <br><br>Original ao dai’s were much more practical for daily activities than the styles worn today. Given they were a looser-fitting garment, people of all professions could wear them comfortably and still go about their daily business.

        <p style="text-align: center; color: chocolate;">Fabric choices for an Ao Dai</p>
        <p class="para_b">
            Designers from the 1920s worked on making the dress more fitted, bringing in elements of European fashion during the French colonial period.

            <br><br>The ao dai was even seen at a Parisian fashion show in 1921, introducing the costume as a fashion garment, which led to several top designers tweaking the dress for their own designs.
            
            <br><br>The tight design became popular during the 1950s, when Saigonese designers introduced the hug-fit which remains popular today.
            
            <br><br>The ao dai’s popularity waned during the American War and the period of independence that followed. As a whole there was less wealth available in the country, and so fashion took a back seat.
            
            <br><br>Here began the shift to the ao dai’s current status as a dress for special occasions and particular occupations.
            
            <br><br>Always more popular in the south than the north, their wearing was less popular during the early days of independence, but in modern times the dress has been firmly recognized by all as an important symbol of Vietnam.
            
            <br><br>Although the ao dai is regarded as a conservative dress – covering the whole body from wrists to ankles – the costume’s close fit nowadays suggests a more complex position.
            
            <br><br>One saying states that ‘the ao dai covers everything, but hides nothing’, which pretty much sums things up!    
        </p>
        
        <h1 class="content__heading" id="c">The current Hoi An Ao Dai</h1>
        <p class="para_b">
            Even though parts of the country may still dress a little more conservatively than people do in the West, it’s common to see Western dress pretty much everywhere you travel in Vietnam, especially amongst the young. Changing times and the practicalities of Vietnam’s climate mean that wearing ao dai on a daily basis is uncomfortable for most.

            <br><br>It’s still possible to see variations on the traditional ao dai costume, including a wider collar, shorter sleeves, higher cuts to the dress or even a long skirt replacing the trousers. But in general the traditional design is adhered to and worn by teachers, older students, receptionists and flight attendants. Many women have one or two ao dai purchased early in adulthood that they’ll wear just a few times a year for special occasions.
            
            <br><br>Ao dai are also popular with tourists and it’s not uncommon to see visitors from other parts of South-east Asia and beyond walking the streets of Hoi An’s Old Town, dressed in a just-made ao dai. Like the Vietnamese non la (conical hat), ao dai make a popular souvenir for many tourists traveling through Vietnam.</p>
